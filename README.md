# MessageBankAPI
Message bank API:

This project allows a user to communicate with a PostgreSQL database using a RESTful endpoint. 

The endpoints are created via spring boot. A front end technology can be used to communicate with these endpoints, or a tool such as 'Postman' can be used.

----------

This project was created to consolidate my understanding of REST API's and using SQL databases. For future improvements. I will include a docker file to allow this project to easily be containerised and deployed.
